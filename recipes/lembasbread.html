        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>"Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith."</i></p>
        <p> This is a simple recipe for Lembas bread that LoTR fans can quickly bake and use for sustenance while watching the directors cut. This recipe contains ingredients which you most likely have in your pantry but in addition calls for honey, heavy whipping cream and brown sugar. This recipe contains no eggs and for a vegan alternative the heavy whipping cream can be switched out for plant based yogurt and the butter switched out for plant based butter.</strong></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and mix with a well till fine granules (easiest way is with an electric mixer). Then add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>Finally add the cream, honey, and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness. Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet. Criss-cross each square from corner-to-corner with a knife, lightly (not cutting through the dough).</li>
            <li>Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely before eating, this bread tastes better room temperature and dry. Also for more flavor you can add more cinnamon or other spices</li>
        </ol>
