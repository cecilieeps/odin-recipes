        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>"Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveler on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith."</i></p>
        <p> This is a simple recipe for Lembas bread that LoTR fans can quickly bake and use for sustenance while watching the directors cut. This recipe contains ingredients which you most likely have in your pantry but in addition calls for honey, heavy whipping cream and brown sugar. This recipe contains no eggs and for a vegan alternative the heavy whipping cream can be switched out for plant based yogurt and the butter switched out for plant based butter.</strong></p>
