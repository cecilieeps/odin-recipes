        <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Sugar Cookies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar (packed)</li>
            <li>2 sticks butter (<i>One stick of butter equates to 113 grams</i>)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp butter flavoring</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Butterbeer Glaze</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup butterscotch chips</li>
            <li>1/8 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 TBSP light corn syrup</li>
            <li>pinch coarse salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Making the sugar cookies</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, set aside.</li>
            <li>Cream the sugar and butter. Add the egg, butter flavoring, and vanilla; mix until well-blended.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour mixture and beat just until combined, scraping down the bowl, especially the bottom. (The dough will be quite thick...you may need to knead in stray bits of flour from the bottom of the bowl by hand.)</li>
            <li>Roll on a floured surface to about 1/4" and cut into shapes. Place on parchment lined baking sheets and bake for 9-12 minutes, depending on the size of your cutter. Let sit a few minutes on the sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making the Butterbeer glaze</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all of the ingredients in a glass or metal bowl and heat over a pot of simmering water (or a double boiler).  Stir occasionally, until melted and smooth.</li>
            <li>Put the cooled cookies on a wire rack on a baking sheet.  Pour the glaze over the cookies and spread with an offset spatula.  If using the fondant house crests, place these on the wet glaze to adhere.</li>
        </ol>
